    <p>&quot;I adoped Jack about 2 years ago from Jazzy Paws just as it was starting up. At first I was quite nervous about adopting a once injured stray but something in me just said I needed to do it. Two years later Jack has won 3 shows and is one of the top show dogs in Ireland! Jazzy Paws treated him with the best care and I owe them my best friend&quot; ~Thomas Wilder</p></div>
